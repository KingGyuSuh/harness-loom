## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-19

First public release.

- **Three user-invocable skills** — `/harness-init` seeds the canonical
  `.claude/` foundation into a target repo; `/harness-pair-dev` adds,
  improves, or splits producer-reviewer pairs anchored to the target
  codebase; `/harness-sync` one-way derives `.codex/` and `.gemini/`
  from `.claude/`.
- **Installed runtime** — `harness-orchestrate`, `harness-planning`,
  `harness-context` skills plus a `harness-planner` agent, coordinated
  through `.harness/state.md` + `.harness/events.md` with Stop-hook
  re-entry.
- **Multi-platform** — Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI.
- **Repo scaffolding** — README, CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY,
  CODE_OF_CONDUCT, PRIVACY, TERMS, and `.github/` issue + PR templates.
