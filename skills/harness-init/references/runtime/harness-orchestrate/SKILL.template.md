# harness-orchestrate

## Design Thinking

Orchestration is **authority design plus judgment before execution**. This skill is the **canonical shared law (SSOT)** for the harness pair/cycle rhythm, exclusive `.harness/` write authority, reviewed-work contract, phase advance, and structural-issue handling, and it also carries orchestrator-only procedure: goal classification, `state.md`/`events.md` editing, one-pair-per-response dispatch, envelope assembly, **writing the next `## Next` block into state before yielding**, Hook re-entry, and retreat handling. Judgment about who runs next and what they should do happens **only at the end of the current turn**; the next turn executes the saved `Next` block exactly. Subagents do not need the full law. They only need envelope-field reading and output shape, and that reduced background is injected through `harness-context`. Script/prompt boundary: init, sync, and hook are script-owned and must not be re-explained here.

## Methodology

### 1. Semantic Contract

#### `state.md` / `events.md` shape

The canonical schema for both files is split into references. Before editing either file, the orchestrator cites those references to lock the shape for the current turn.

- `references/state-md-schema.md` — the three-line header (`Goal` / `Phase` / `loop`), the `## Next` block (`To` / `EPIC` / `Task path` / `Intent` / `Prior tasks` / `Prior reviews`), the `## EPIC summaries` structure (one `### EP-N--slug` heading plus `outcome` / `roster` / `current` / `note`), and the mutation rule (append-only, with terminal `current` states `done|superseded`)
- `references/events-md-format.md` — the one-line format `<ISO-ts> T<id> <role> <outcome> — <note>` plus append cadence and the invariant that only the orchestrator writes the log

The Semantic Contract, Turn Algorithm, Interfaces, and Exceptional Paths in this skill all assume those references as the canonical shape source.

#### Authority Rules

- Every file under `.harness/` is written **only by the orchestrator**. That includes `state.md`, `events.md`, task files, and review files.
- Producers and reviewers return only their Output Format blocks. They never write control-plane state directly. `Suggested next-work`, `Advisory-next`, and `Escalation` are advisory inputs; the orchestrator synthesizes the real `Next` block from them.
- Subagents run with `fork_context=false`. Conversation transcript, tool trace, and producer inner reasoning are never passed to reviewers. Reviewers judge **only one task file recorded on disk**.
- The orchestrator assembles the envelope. Subagents do not read `state.md` and infer routing themselves; they trust only Goal, Focus EPIC, Task path, Scope, Current phase, and Prior tasks/reviews supplied in the envelope.
- The planner is a meta-role with no paired reviewer. It leaves no task/review files and returns state-ready EPIC summaries only. The actual `state.md` write is still append-only and still orchestrator-owned.

#### Reviewed-Work Contract

One pair turn leaves the following files on disk; the orchestrator provides the paths in the envelope:

- **Task** (exactly 1) — `.harness/epics/EP-N--{slug}/tasks/T{id}--{task-slug}.md`. This is the producer artifact. It carries the main body, evidence, self-verification, and suggested-next-work.
- **Review** (one per reviewer, so 1 or M files) — `.harness/epics/EP-N--{slug}/reviews/T{id}--{task-slug}--{reviewer-name}.md`. The `{reviewer-name}` suffix keeps 1:M reviews collision-free. Each review contains PASS/FAIL plus criteria-cited evidence limited to that reviewer's axis.

Rework never overwrites the same task id. The orchestrator allocates a fresh `T<id>`, leaving the previous task and all related reviews intact. Structural retreat follows the same rule. The planner is the only exception: it leaves no task/review files, so its trail is the `events.md` entry plus the `state.md` EPIC summary diff.

### 2. Turn Algorithm

#### Pair rhythm (one response = consume `Next`, produce the next `Next`)

The execution order of one orchestrator response is fixed:

1. Read `references/state-md-schema.md` and `references/events-md-format.md` first, so the read/write shape for this turn is locked.
2. At turn start, **always write `loop: false` into `state.md` first** to lock out re-entry. Codex/Gemini hooks may also fire on subagent completion, so this lock is the first write of every orchestrator turn whether or not `Next` exists.
3. Read `state.md` and inspect the `## Next` block. If it is empty or absent, branch to Cold start / Halt under Exceptional Paths.
4. Assemble the `Next` block into an envelope and dispatch `Next.To` with `fork_context=false`.
   - **4-a. Pair producer turn** — if `Next.To != planner`, write the returned artifact into `Next.Task path`.
   - **4-b. Planner turn** — if `Next.To == planner`, do not create task/review files. Append the planner's `EPICs (this turn)` block into `state.md` `## EPIC summaries`, and write one planner result line into `events.md`. If `Additional pairs required` is non-empty, append it as a separate orchestrator note in `events.md` so it can flow back into future planner recalls through `Recent events`.
5. Handle the reviewer branch.
   - **5-a. Planner turn** — skip reviewer dispatch and jump to step 8. The planner has no paired reviewer.
   - **5-b. Pair producer turn** — dispatch the paired reviewer(s) **in parallel within the same response**. For 1:M pairs, send all M reviewer calls together. They are independent and receive no producer transcript, so parallelism is safe.
6. On pair producer turns, write each reviewer return into `.harness/epics/EP-N--{slug}/reviews/T<id>--<task-slug>--<reviewer-name>.md`.
7. On pair producer turns, aggregate the verdicts. For 1:M pairs: `all PASS -> PASS`, `any FAIL -> FAIL` with merged rework reasons, and `any structural -> Retreat` with the most-upstream structural report winning. If multiple structural reports point equally upstream, prefer the first report received.
8. **Synthesize the next `Next` block**.
   - **8-a. Planner turn** — seed the next dispatch from the first live EPIC in the just-updated EPIC summaries. New EPICs start with the first roster producer as `current`. If all EPICs are terminal, branch to halt. If the planner emitted **no executable EPICs** and only `Additional pairs required`, also halt: clear `Next`, keep `loop: false`, and tell the user to add the required pairs with `/harness-pair-dev --add <slug> --purpose ...` and then re-run `/harness-orchestrate <goal.md>`.
   - **8-b. Pair producer turn** — apply the Phase advance rules below using the aggregated verdict, overall EPIC progress, and any structural issues.
9. Update the `Next` block, the `Phase` header, and the current EPIC `current` field in `state.md`, then append this turn's events (one producer entry, M reviewer entries, plus any orchestrator note) to `events.md`.
10. Only if a valid next dispatch exists, raise `loop: true` and yield. If every EPIC is terminal (`done` or `superseded`) or the halt branch fired, clear `Next`, keep `loop: false`, and stop.

Never mix multiple pairs in one response. One pair = one producer plus its reviewer set. Planner exceptions exist only in steps 4-b, 5-a, and 8-a. In all other steps, read the procedure as pair-turn logic. `loop` always goes false at turn start and only goes true again at turn end after a valid new `Next` has been committed.

#### Phase advance — synthesizing the next `Next`

This section applies only to **pair producer turns**. Planner turns are handled by Turn Algorithm step 8-a. The four rules below apply only when reviewer verdicts exist. All judgment happens **once at the end of the current turn**, and the result is written into `state.md` `## Next`.

1. **Rework** — aggregated verdict is FAIL (or `any FAIL` in 1:M):
   - `Next.To` = the same producer
   - `Next.EPIC` = the same EPIC
   - `Next.Intent` = `Rework (reviewer FAIL): <summary of FAIL reasons>`; in 1:M merge reviewer reasons with axis tags
   - `Next.Prior tasks` = `[the task file just written]`
   - `Next.Prior reviews` = `[all review files that failed]`, plus PASS review files if needed so already-passing axes are preserved
2. **Retreat (structural)** — producer or reviewer reports a structural issue:
   - `Next.To` = the `Suspected upstream stage` from the most-upstream structural report; if necessary this may be `planner`
   - `Next.EPIC` = the same EPIC, unless retreating to planner in which case the full existing EPIC list is included in the planner envelope
   - `Next.Intent` = `(retreat reason: <reason>). <what the upstream stage must redesign>`
   - `Next.Prior tasks` = `[the latest task from the retreat target stage]`
   - `Next.Prior reviews` = `[the structural issue review]`
   - rewind the EPIC's `current` to the retreat target producer
3. **Forward advance (PASS)** — reviewer PASS:
   - first move the just-passed EPIC's `current` to the next roster slug, or to `done` if the roster is exhausted
   - scan **all EPICs** and select the live EPIC whose `current` sits at the **earliest roster position**; ties break by smaller EPIC number
   - if such an EPIC exists, fill `Next.To`, `Next.EPIC`, `Next.Intent`, `Next.Prior tasks`, and `Next.Prior reviews` from that EPIC's current stage
4. **Halt (all terminated)** — if every EPIC has terminal `current` (`done` or `superseded`), clear `Next` and keep `loop: false`

The `Phase` header is always an echo of `Next.To`. Rework keeps the same producer. Retreat rewinds `current` upstream. Forward advance moves `current` to the next roster slug or to `done`.

### 3. Interfaces

#### Dispatch envelope

Producers and reviewers run with `fork_context=false`, so they do not inherit transcript context. The orchestrator must carry global context into the prompt through the envelope.

Shared blocks:

- **Goal** — the `Goal (from X):` paragraph copied from `state.md`
- **Focus EPIC** — the `Next.EPIC` slug plus that EPIC's one-line `outcome`, or `(none)` / existing EPIC list for planner turns
- **Pair skill** — already injected through `skills:` frontmatter, but still named in one line as `rubric: skills/<slug>/SKILL.md`
- **Task path** — copied from `Next.Task path`
- **Scope** — one sentence defining allowed file/path surfaces for this turn, synthesized from the pair skill's scope
- **Current phase** — copied from `Next.Intent`; this is the field that tells the subagent what to do now
- **Axis (reviewer only)** — in a 1:M pair, each reviewer envelope names the grading axis owned by that reviewer. In 1:1 it may be omitted or set to `Axis: (entire pair)`

Variable blocks:

- **Prior tasks** — array copied from `Next.Prior tasks`
- **Prior reviews** — array copied from `Next.Prior reviews`

Planner-only additions:

- **Existing EPICs** — the full `## EPIC summaries` block from `state.md`
- **Recent events** — the last five lines of `events.md`

Subagents trust only the envelope. They do not read `state.md` and infer routing. Reviewers judge only one task file plus the pair skill; they do not inspect producer transcript or tool trace.

#### Context propagation

Each pair agent frontmatter `skills:` declares the shared pair skill plus `harness-context`, so both are auto-injected at dispatch. The envelope carries only what those skills do not cover: Goal, Focus EPIC, Task path, Scope, Current phase, and Prior artifacts. The full shared law and routing rules in this skill are not injected into subagents because those are not subagent concerns.

#### Structural Issue handling

When a producer or reviewer detects an upstream contract failure that **cannot be solved inside the current pair**, the review file must report it in the shape below. The same shape is repeated in `harness-context`.

```markdown
## Structural Issue

- Suspected upstream stage: {producer name}
- Blocked contract: {what cannot be satisfied}
- Why this pair cannot resolve it: {reason}
- Evidence: {concrete task or review evidence}
- Suggested repair focus: {what the upstream producer should revisit}
```

Use this when: (a) the current artifact depends on an upstream artifact that is invalid, (b) the pair contract itself is wrong, or (c) an agent-skill mismatch makes downstream work impossible.
Do not use this when: ordinary reviewer FAIL feedback can still be resolved by re-dispatching the same producer.

### 4. Exceptional Paths

#### Cold start / Halt

- **Cold start** — if `state.md` has no `Next` block and no EPIC summaries yet, treat the turn as a cold start. `loop: false` has already been written at the top of the turn. As the first action, synthesize the initial `Next`: `To: planner`, `EPIC: (none)`, `Intent: read the full goal.md and decompose it into EPICs`, then execute it in the same turn. Only raise `loop: true` at the end if a valid next dispatch exists.
- **Manual halt / terminal halt** — if the user manually clears the `Next` block, halt immediately. Automatic halt follows Phase advance rule 4. Both keep `loop: false` and the Hook does not re-enter.

#### Goal-anchored entry

When `/harness-orchestrate <filename.md>` is invoked:

1. Read `<filename.md>` and treat the **entire trimmed body** as the Goal string. Do not require load-bearing headers such as `# Goal` or `## Constraints`.
2. Compare it semantically to the existing `Goal (from X):` in `state.md`.
   - **same** (or previous Goal empty) -> no-op. Continue routing from the current `Next` block and EPIC summaries. If state is empty, branch to Cold start.
   - **refined** (scope expanded or detailed) -> replace the current `Next` with a planner recall. The planner appends new EPICs or marks old ones as `superseded` and appends replacements, never mutating old fields in place.
   - **different** (clearly different intent or domain) -> reset. Call `init.ts`, archive the previous cycle, and re-enter through Cold start.
3. The classification is the orchestrator's semantic judgment. Do not ask the user for confirmation, because the Hook re-entry environment has no interactive channel. Do not require marker headers inside the goal markdown either.

#### Hook re-entry

Hook (`.harness/hook.sh`) checks whether `state.md` has `loop: true` and, if so, re-invokes `/harness-orchestrate`. The slash command is hard-coded at install time and is not read from `state.md`. The Hook is a re-entry mechanism, not a cadence driver. Every response ends with `state.md` write-back, especially the next `Next` block, and then yield.

## Evaluation Criteria

- The description includes both `/harness-orchestrate <file.md>` and Hook re-entry trigger vocabulary in active form.
- The body assumes the shapes from `references/state-md-schema.md` and `references/events-md-format.md` without duplicating those schemas inline.
- The Phase advance rules fill the `Next` block field set (`To` / `EPIC` / `Task path` / `Intent` / `Prior tasks` / `Prior reviews`) deterministically.
- The three guarantees one-pair-per-response, Phase advance synthesized **once at end of turn**, and next turn executes `Next` **as written** read as one connected flow inside the Turn Algorithm.
- The least-advanced EPIC selection rule is explicit: smallest roster position first, then smallest EPIC number.
- Exceptional Paths make Cold start, Hook re-entry, and the three goal-entry branches (no-op / refine / reset) easy to find.
- Script/prompt boundary is preserved: install/init/sync/hook implementation details are only cited by path, not duplicated here.
- `Authority Rules`, `Reviewed-Work Contract`, and `Structural Issue handling` stay in this body so reviewers can grade them without outside citations.
- Planner meta-role exceptions, no-task-file output, and append-only EPIC mutation are all explicitly stated.
- Context propagation states that subagents get `harness-context` rather than the full orchestrator law.

## Taboos

- Put pipe tables or cell-oriented formatting into `state.md`. The correct shape is header + `Next` block + headed EPIC list.
- Collapse all EPIC summaries into one prose blob that hides per-EPIC identity.
- Use numeric phase slugs. `Phase: skill-writer` is correct; `Phase: 1` is wrong.
- Dispatch more than one producer+reviewer pair in a single response.
- Let a subagent write the `Next` block directly.
- Defer routing judgment to a later turn and leave `Next` empty or ambiguous this turn.
- Reuse a `T<id>` and erase the trace of rework.
- Re-explain init/sync/hook script internals inside this skill body.
- Ask the user for confirmation while classifying a goal change, or require marker headers in the goal markdown.
- Record planner output as task files. Planner updates only `state.md` `## EPIC summaries`.
- Mutate an existing EPIC's `outcome`, `roster`, or `upstream` in place. Mark it `superseded` and append a new EPIC instead.
- Move directly gradeable contract blocks such as `Authority Rules`, `Reviewed-Work Contract`, `Phase advance`, or `Structural Issue handling` out into references, leaving only a citation. Those must remain in the body for isolated grading.
- Copy phase advance, state schema, or Hook re-entry law into the subagent-facing `harness-context`. That is orchestrator-only noise.
